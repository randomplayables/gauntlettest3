# Number Guessing Game

A simple two-player number guessing game built with React and TypeScript. The challenger selects a secret number, and the opponent tries to guess it. Feedback is provided after each guess until the correct number is found.

## How to Play

1. Challenger selects a secret number within the allowed range.
2. Opponent enters a guess and submits.
3. Feedback will indicate whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Repeat steps 2â€“3 until the opponent guesses the correct number.
5. View the history of guesses to strategize your next attempt.
